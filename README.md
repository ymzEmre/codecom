## Introduction

The name, comes from the words "Code" and "Competition".

Codecom is being developed using the Performance API to measure the execution time of JavaScript code and to display the results both within the terminal and in an HTML file, allowing them to be viewed in the browser as well.

## Motivation

When developing a software, usually, attention is not paid to the milisecond-level execution time of the code. However, in some cases;

- When the application will run on a device with limited resources,
- When evaluating and improving the performance of the code,
- When processing big data, deciding on the optimal solution method,
- When comparing the performance of different codes,
- When seeking to enhance the user experience by reducing the waiting time of the user.

In such cases, it is necessary to measure the execution time of the code and to compare the results.

Codecom, is developed to make this process easier and more enjoyable.

## Features

- No dependencies
- Easy to use
- No magic, just simple use and effective.

## Installation

```
npm install codecom
```

Create a new file named `codecom.js` in the root directory of your project and copy the following code into it.

```JavaScript
import codecom from 'codecom'
```

## Usage

To test code;

- Add the `// _start()` code to the beginning of where your code's scope start.
- Add the `// _end()` code to the end of where your code's scope end.

#### Example

```JavaScript
// _start()
for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
  console.log(i)
}
// _end()
```

#### Run

Add the following code to the `package.json` file.

```JSON
"scripts": {
  "codecom": "node --watch codecom.js"
}
```

Run the following command in the terminal.

```bash
npm run codecom
```

#### Output

Results will be displayed in the terminal and in the `codecom.html` file.
